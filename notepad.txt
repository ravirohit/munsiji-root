-> git init
-> git status
-> git add *
-> git commit -m "my first commit"
-> git remote add origin https://github.com/ravirohit/munsiji-root.git
-> git push --set-upstream origin master
------ steps to deploy the code:
-> open the webapp folder in the visual basic code
-> the the below command in the URL:
   #npm run build      // it will create the compiled file in the dest folder 
   Note: in the index.html is kind of home page which is loading all the file inside the dest folder. make file  is linked properly.
-> for now, munsiji-persistance.jar is not adding to the munsiji-service.war file after build. So, i am manually adding it to the munsiji-service.war file.
   add this munsiji-service.war file to the deployment folder of the wildfly.
